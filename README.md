## Inspiration
Covid has changed how people work and live. Technologies, like Zoom, Google Meets, etc., are more essential than ever as virtual events becoming a new normal. 

We noticed that there are people who struggle using these applications but they are required to master them. For example, teachers and professors suddenly have to teach virtually and learn different technologies while having to adjust to the new normal. Tech Buddy aims to bridge this gap by making it easier for people to learn these tools by providing easy step-by-step tutorials.

We also acknowledged that the pandemic has put people's mental health at risk, especially those who are isolated and unable to visit their families and loved ones. It is very important for people to stay connected virtually and there are a lot of technologies that provide those. However, some people are not comfortable trying new technologies as they could be overwhelming. Tech Buddy will hopefully elevate some of these anxieties around using new technologies!

## What it does
It provides step-by-step tutorials with amazing visuals for various applications, such as Zoom, Google Meets, Facebook, Youtube, Spotify, etc. It also has quizzes and games for people to test their knowledge.

## How we built it
We built our application using React and Firebase. The Firebase is used for hosting the application. 
We designed the application and created a demo using Figma. 
We also used starter code from an open-source project. (https://github.com/briancodex/react-website-v1.git) 

## Challenges we ran into
We were having a hard time figuring out how to start and implement things because we were all not familiar with either React or Javascript. We also struggled to style things to mimic the Figma design. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are especially proud to just be able to deliver a final demo product! But above that, we are proud of the potential impact of our web-app, especially during these unprecedented times.  

## What we learned
So many things we learned just within the 24 hours:
* Teamwork
* Web app development
* Figma
* React
* Firebase
* HTML, CSS (especially grid and flex-box!)
* Product planning

## What's next for Tech Buddy
Our goal is to expand the app to be more interactive where it could also support community-building and networking. These are some of the features that we would like to implement in the future:
* AI bot to help with questions
* Open-source blog style where other people could post and review the tutorials 
* Find and host virtual events around learning new technologies together
* Integration with Google Chrome Extension, so it will automatically open up the tutorial guide as users open certain web-applications (e.g. facebook.com will open up another tab for facebook tutorial from our app)
* Android and iOS applications
