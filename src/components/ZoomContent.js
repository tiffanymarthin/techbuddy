        You probably wonder that what these buttons actually do? Don’t worry, I
        will explain what they mean and how do you use it step by step.

        This button can control your microphone within Zoom. Unlike in-person
        conversation, it’s a good manner to mute yourself when you are not
        talking/speaking so that other people in the room can hear clearly what
        the speaker is saying without any distraction. Don’t worry. The way you
        Mute/ Unmute yourself is pretty easy! All you have to do is click on it.
        Once you click on the button, the red crossed line will appear on top of
        the microphone icon. It means that you’re muted so no one can hear you
        even though you’re talking. Make sure to turn it back on before you
        speak!! The buttons will look like these :
      </p>
